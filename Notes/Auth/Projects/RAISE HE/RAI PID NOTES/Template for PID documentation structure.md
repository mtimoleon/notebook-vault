**Definition of RAISE Persistent Identifier (RAISE PID)**  
A **RAISE** **Persistent Identifier (PID)** is a long-lasting reference to a digital object — a single files. As the name suggests, it remains unchanged even if the digital object moves to a different location. This makes RAISE PIDs crucial for digital preservation and data citation, as they ensure that digital objects remain accessible over time.  
**Key Characteristics of RAISE PID**  
**// Lets write something about FAIR here**

1. **Uniqueness**: Each PID is unique to the digital object it identifies. This means that no two digital objects will have the same PID.
2. **Persistence**: PIDs are designed to last indefinitely. They remain associated with the digital object they identify, even if the object is moved or modified.
3. **Resolvable**: PIDs are often associated with a resolution service that allows them to be translated into the current URL of the digital object they identify.
4. **Reliable**: PIDs are maintained by trusted organizations, ensuring their reliability and integrity.

**Importance of PIDs**  
PIDs are essential in the digital world for several reasons:

- **Access**: PIDs provide a stable link to digital content, ensuring it can always be found.
- **Citation**: PIDs allow digital objects to be accurately cited in academic research.
- **Tracking and Metrics**: PIDs enable the tracking of usage metrics for digital objects.
- **Interoperability**: PIDs allow different systems to reliably reference and access the same digital object.

In conclusion, PIDs play a vital role in managing, preserving, and providing access to digital information. They are an essential tool in the world of digital preservation and open science.
