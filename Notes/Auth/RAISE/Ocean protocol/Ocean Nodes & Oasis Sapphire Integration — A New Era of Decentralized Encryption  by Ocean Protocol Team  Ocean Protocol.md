Today we are excited to announce the upcoming **integration of Ocean Nodes with** **Oasis Sapphire****, to enhance encryption, security, and privacy across the network, while also introducing a revamped incentives program that will better reward node operators for their contributions. By integrating the Oasis SDK, we are taking another step towards achieving our goal of democratized computing, empowering everyone to create and use AI without sacrificing privacy or control.**  
This post will cover the information on the Oasis Sapphire integration, the improvements to our encryption model, and the exciting overhaul of our incentives program.  
In the past, encryption on the Ocean Network relied on a private key stored by the desired Ocean Provider. This system had two major drawbacks:

1. **Trust Issues**: Users had to trust the provider to keep the encryption key secure.
2. **Provider Dependency**: If the provider went offline, the user had to republish the asset with a new provider.

The integration of Oasis Sapphire eliminates these concerns by **decentralizing encryption**, ensuring that no single node holds undue control. With Sapphire, encryption is managed across the network, providing a more secure and resilient system.  
Additionally, we’ve introduced **NFT-based** trusted node lists, allowing anyone to create a trust list. Only nodes on that list can decrypt and serve assets, ensuring enhanced security and reducing the need to trust individual providers.

## Incentives Overhauled: Moving to Oasis Sapphire

Since [the launch of the Ocean Nodes](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-ocean-nodes-decentralized-practical-solution-for-building-powerful-ai-c72fc6747165) in August, we’ve received a lot of positive feedback from you, and the number of nodes grew beyond our expectations–currently sitting at [24,598 nodes](https://nodes.oceanprotocol.com/) (at the time of publication).  
During Epoch 2 (Week 37), we realized that 81% of nodes received under 1 FET in rewards, and more than $1,000 in gas fees were spent–which we thought should be put to better use, that is to be redirected to you. Keep reading.  
To resolve this, we got to thinking and calculating and we overhauled the incentives program, bringing with it a host of improvements:

1. **Move the incentive program to Oasis Sapphire**: this will reduce gas fees and leverage the existing tech stack.
2. **Incentives in ROSE**: Future incentives will be distributed in ROSE, the native token of the Oasis Network.
3. **Uptime Criteria**: To encourage stable and reliable nodes, only nodes with at least 90% uptime will be eligible for rewards each week (lowered from the industry standard of 95%). The total incentive pool will be split evenly between all eligible nodes.
4. **250,000 ROSE per Epoch**: We will distribute a total of 250,000 ROSE per epoch, giving significant incentive to maintain high availability. That’s \>2x of rewards.

We’ll let you focus on point 4 of the above for a while.

Now, of course this requires a bit of time and work on our end, and patience on your end. This means that, in order for all of the above to be achieved and to make the transition to Oasis Sapphire as smooth as possible, we are **temporarily pausing** **the distribution of incentives**. Monitoring will continue, and **your rewards will accumulate during this period**. Once the move to Sapphire is complete, the cumulated rewards will be converted into ROSE and distributed to eligible nodes.  
For Epochs 3 and 4 the allocation and eligibility criteria will remain the same, but incentives will not be distributed at the end of the epochs. As said, after we transition to Oasis Sapphire, we will distribute the previously cumulated rewards in ROSE, ensuring no one misses out on their well-earned rewards.

## Summary: What Node Operators Need to Know

1. **Higher rewards for reliable nodes**: Nodes that maintain 90% uptime or higher will qualify for rewards, with a significant reward pool of 250,000 ROSE per epoch.
2. **Rewards will accumulate**: Even though incentives will not be distributed until the integration is complete, your rewards will still be tracked and cumulated.
3. **ROSE Rewards**: Once incentives resume, rewards will be distributed in ROSE, benefiting from lower gas fees and efficient distribution.

The transition to Oasis Sapphire represents a major leap forward in our commitment to decentralization, privacy, and security. With better incentives (250K ROSE), more efficient rewards, and a fully decentralized encryption system, Ocean Nodes are now positioned to support the future of AI and data sharing on a global scale.  
We are excited to see how this new phase empowers our community, and we remain dedicated to providing a network that rewards active participation and maintains the highest standards of decentralization and privacy.
