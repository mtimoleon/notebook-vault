Έκπτωση να πάει στο 20%  
Να γράψουμε plugins και να γίνεται config από bonvita για κάθε device με default plugins enabled
   

CAPTAIN coach provides a cloud api that is used for the plugins marketplace. With the endpoints provided by this api, the caregiver can find all the available plug-ins. Each plug-in has a predefined configuration of what activities the user will be proposed to perform. Caregiver will have the option to preconfigure one or many plugins for a specific device-user. The selection of the plug-in for a device-user takes place through the BONVITA interface which then sends the selected configurations for a specific device-user to the CAPTAIN central cloud api. Then this plugin can be set by default for a user on this device during the user registration phase.
