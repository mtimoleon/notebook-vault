## How to prepare for possible laptop theft

Obviously, nobody expects their laptop to get stolen, but it can happen to anyone. It’s important to take steps to protect yourself while your computer (and your sensitive data) is still in your possession, as it makes recovering from a notebook theft much easier. In particular, you should make sure to:

### Encrypt your data

You can encrypt your hard drive so that no one can access your sensitive information (like saved passwords and your credit card info) even if they have physical access to your laptop.  
If your computer is running Windows, take a few minutes to set up [BitLocker](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2308725/a-beginners-guide-to-bitlocker-windows-built-in-encryption-tool.html), which can encrypt your drive. You’ll need to pick a password to access your data, so make sure to follow all the usual [password best practices](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3604059/how-to-pick-the-perfect-password.html). (Above all, don’t write it on a post-it note and stick it on your laptop.)  
If you’re open to using third party software, you can also download [Absolute Home & Office](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569483&url=https://homeoffice.absolute.com/&xcust=2-1-394850-1-0-0&sref=https://www.pcworld.com/article/394850/what-to-do-when-your-laptop-is-stolen-and-how-to-prepare-for-it.html) (formerly LoJack for Laptops). In addition to encrypting your drive, it also makes it easier to take some of the other measures described in this article, such as tracing your laptop’s location and remotely deleting your data.

When you’re doing this, make sure **not** to update the autofill function so that the passwords on your missing laptop aren’t synced and updated.  
If you use a [password manager](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3207185/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html) like LastPass, 1Password, or Dashlane, you can wipe and uninstall all your passwords that are synced with your lost laptop. (Installing this is something else that has to be done ahead of time).  
**Disable autofill and clear your browsing data**  
After changing your passwords, delete your browser data, such as your autofill settings and browsing history.

If you’re using Chrome, you can do this remotely by opening the browser menu (click the three dots in the top-right corner of the window) and clicking _Settings_.

Next, click _Autofill \> Passwords_ and then toggle the slider next to “Auto Sign-in” to the off position.  
**Deauthorize your account and devices**  
If you use a Google account, sign out of Chrome remotely to deauthorize your device. Firefox and Safari also allow remote sign-outs.  
If you’re using an Apple laptop, you can remotely log out of any device signed in with your Apple ID. Make sure you also turn off auto-sync between your linked devices to prevent your sensitive information from being synced on your missing laptop.  
It’s nerve-wracking to realize your laptop’s been stolen, but don’t panic. Although there’s no way to tell whether you’ll see it again, if you stay calm and act quickly, there’s a very good chance you’ll be able to safeguard your data and protect yourself from consequences beyond the immediate loss.
