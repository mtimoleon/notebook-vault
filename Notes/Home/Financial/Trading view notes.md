### **- Heikin Ashi**
 
From the above formulas, it becomes clear that the current candlestick of the indicator is calculated with a delay, therefore the signals given by Heikin Ashi are of a lagging nature. In this case, the calculations of a new candle will be possible only after the next one appears on the price chart.
 
When trading volatile instruments on small timeframes, the indicator can help to effectively filter out market noise, false breakouts, and entry points. It is worth noting, however, that when working on a market with low volatility and/or on large timeframes, Heikin Ashi will rarely give signals. Moreover, the reliability of these signals will be low, due to the delay of the indicator itself.
