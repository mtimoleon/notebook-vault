The **Sybil AI** algorithm, developed through a collaboration between MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital, is indeed available as an open-source tool. Here’s how you can access and utilize it for research purposes:

## Accessing Sybil AI

1. **Open Source Availability**: The Sybil AI algorithm and its code are publicly available, allowing researchers and institutions to use it without any associated costs. This initiative aims to encourage global collaboration and further studies on lung cancer risk prediction.
2. **GitHub Repository**: You can find the Sybil AI code on its GitHub repository, which provides the necessary resources for implementation and experimentation. The repository includes documentation on how to set up and run the algorithm.

    .
    
3. **Clinical Trials**: While the algorithm is open source, it is still in the experimental phase. Researchers are conducting clinical trials to determine its practical applications and effectiveness in real-world settings. Thus, while anyone can access the code, using it for patient care is not yet recommended until further validation is completed

.

5. **Research Collaboration**: If you are a researcher or part of an institution interested in using Sybil, you may want to collaborate with ongoing studies or contribute to further research to explore its capabilities and limitations.
 
## Considerations for Use

- **Experimental Phase**: Although Sybil is available for use, it is essential to understand that it has not yet been fully validated for routine clinical practice. Its predictions are based on a majority-male cohort, which raises considerations regarding equity in outcomes across different demographics

.

- **Future Developments**: As research progresses, updates regarding Sybil's performance and recommendations for clinical use will be published. Keeping track of these developments will help you understand when it might be appropriate to implement Sybil in patient care settings.

By accessing the open-source version of Sybil AI, you can participate in advancing research in lung cancer risk prediction while staying informed about its clinical applications as they evolve.
