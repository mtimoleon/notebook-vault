Currently, there is no publicly accessible platform for individuals to directly use **Sybil AI** for lung cancer risk assessment online. Sybil is primarily designed to be integrated into clinical settings, specifically within radiology departments, where it analyzes low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans in real-time.

## How Sybil is Used in Clinical Settings:

1. **Clinical Integration**: Sybil operates within standard radiology reading stations, meaning it is used by healthcare professionals during the analysis of LDCT scans.
2. **Point-of-Care Support**: The tool provides clinical decision support by predicting lung cancer risk based on the analysis of a single LDCT scan, without requiring additional clinical data or annotations from radiologists.
3. **Research and Validation**: While Sybil has shown promising results in studies, it is still undergoing further validation in diverse populations and prospective trials to confirm its effectiveness.

## Next Steps for Individuals:

- **Consult Your Healthcare Provider**: If you are interested in using Sybil for lung cancer screening, discuss with your healthcare provider whether they have access to this technology as part of their diagnostic tools.
- **Participate in Clinical Trials**: Keep an eye out for clinical trials or studies that may offer access to Sybil as part of their research protocols.
- **Stay Informed**: Follow updates from institutions like the Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT, as they may announce future developments regarding the broader availability of Sybil or similar AI tools for public use.
