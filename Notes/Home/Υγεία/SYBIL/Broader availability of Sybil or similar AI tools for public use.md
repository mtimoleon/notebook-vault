**Sybil AI** is currently available as an open-source tool, allowing researchers and institutions to access and utilize its capabilities for predicting lung cancer risk based on low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans. Here’s how you can use Sybil and what to expect regarding its availability:

## Accessing Sybil AI

1. **Open Source Availability**: The algorithm and its code have been made publicly available by the research teams at MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital. This means that anyone interested in using Sybil for research purposes can access it for free.
2. **Implementation in Clinical Settings**: While Sybil can be used by researchers, it is primarily designed to be integrated into clinical workflows within radiology departments. It analyzes LDCT scans as part of the diagnostic process.
3. **Current Use**: As of now, Sybil is still in the experimental phase, undergoing clinical trials to validate its effectiveness and determine how best to implement it in patient care. It is not yet recommended for general public use outside of controlled studies.
4. **Research Collaboration**: Researchers around the world are encouraged to study Sybil further, which may lead to new insights and applications in lung cancer screening.

## Future Developments

- **Clinical Trials**: Ongoing trials are being conducted to assess how Sybil can assist in real-world patient management. Results from these studies are expected within the next couple of years, which will help clarify its strengths and limitations.
- **Broader Applications**: There is potential for Sybil to be adapted for other types of cancers or different populations, which researchers are actively exploring.
- **Updates from Developers**: Keep an eye on announcements from MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital regarding future developments, enhancements, or broader availability of Sybil.

## Conclusion

While you cannot directly use Sybil AI as an individual for personal health assessments at this time, you can participate in discussions with healthcare providers about its potential application or follow developments related to ongoing clinical trials. The open-source nature of Sybil encourages further research, which may eventually lead to more widespread clinical use.
