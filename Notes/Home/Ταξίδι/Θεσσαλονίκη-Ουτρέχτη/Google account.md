Setting up an emergency liaison or contact for your Google Account can be done through **Android's Personal Safety features** (for immediate, on-the-spot emergencies) or by configuring **account recovery settings** (for long-term or access emergencies). 

Here are the best ways to set this up:

### 1. Set Emergency Contacts on Android (Best for Immediate Safety) 

If you use an Android phone, you can add emergency contacts who can be notified or access your location during an emergency. 

- **Open the Personal Safety App:** Open the **Safety app** (or **Settings > Safety & emergency** on some phones).
- **Add Emergency Contacts:** Tap **Emergency contacts** and select individuals from your contact list.
- **Enable Lock Screen Access:** Ensure **Show on lock screen** is turned on so first responders can contact them without unlocking your phone.
- **Emergency SOS:** You can configure your phone to call emergency services and share info with these contacts by pressing the power button 5 times. 

### 2. Set Up an Inactive Account Manager (Best for Long-Term Access) 

If you want to designate someone to take over your account if you are unreachable for a long time, use the "Inactive Account Manager." 

- Go to your Google Account settings.
- Navigate to **Data & privacy**.
- Scroll down to **Download or delete your data** and select **Make a plan for your digital legacy**.
- You can set a timeout period (e.g., 3, 6, 12, or 18 months). If you do not log in, Google will notify your designated person via email and can share your data with them. 

### 3. Add a Recovery Contact (Best for Account Access Emergencies) 

To ensure someone can help you if you are locked out, add them as a recovery contact. 

- Go to your Google Account Security page.
- In the "How you sign in to Google" section, click **Recovery contacts**.
- Click **Add recovery contact** and enter their email address. 

### 4. Provide Backup Codes (Best for Immediate Access) 

For someone to log in to your account during an emergency without triggering security alerts, they will need your password and a way to pass 2-Step Verification. 

- Generate and print **Backup Codes** from your Security Settings (under 2-Step Verification).
- Give a physical copy of these codes to your trusted contact.
