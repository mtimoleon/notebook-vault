==What will happen to events in memory if the system fall?==
       24. ==Q:== _Why Item AR is called ItemManagement but PO AR is called just PurchaseOrder?_

==The namespace name reflects the name of the context you are in. So in the context of item management, the Item is the root and it is placed in the ItemManagement namespace. You can also think of ItemManagement as the== **Aggregate** ==and Item as the== **Root** ==of this aggregate. I'm not sure if this answers your question.==
