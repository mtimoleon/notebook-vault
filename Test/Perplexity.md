BriaCell says breast cancer patient's lung tumor gone for 11 months

BriaCell Therapeutics announced Monday that a patient with metastatic breast cancer achieved sustained complete resolution of a lung metastasis for 11 months following treatment with its experimental ==immunotherapy Bria-OTS==, marking an extended durability milestone for the clinical-stage biotechnology company's personalized cancer therapy.

The 78-year-old patient with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced disease had failed multiple prior lines of therapy before enrolling in the Phase 1/2a study in November 2024. After receiving just four doses of Bria-OTS monotherapy, her lung tumor completely disappeared—a response first observed at two months and subsequently confirmed at four, six, and now 11 months.[globenewswire +2](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/13/3217681/0/en/BriaCell-Reports-Sustained-Complete-Resolution-of-Lung-Metastasis-in-Bria-OTS-Patient.html)

Sustained Response Without Major Side Effects

The patient received 17 treatment cycles, completed 12 months on the study, and remains in survival follow-up, according to the company. No treatment-limiting toxicities were reported throughout her participation, and she maintained stable disease at all other evaluable sites.[globenewswire +2](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/13/3217681/0/en/BriaCell-Reports-Sustained-Complete-Resolution-of-Lung-Metastasis-in-Bria-OTS-Patient.html)

"The sustained clinical response observed in this late-stage MBC patient, who had previously progressed through multiple prior treatments is remarkable," stated Neal S. Chawla, MD, Director at the Sarcoma Oncology Center in Santa Monica, California, and Principal Investigator for the Bria-OTS study. "We are excited to further evaluate Bria-OTS in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in metastatic breast cancer."

Trial Advances to Combination Phase

BriaCell has completed the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study and has now entered the Phase 2a segment, which will evaluate Bria-OTS combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The therapy is based on BriaCell's lead candidate Bria-IMT, which is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3 trial that Nature Medicine featured among "Eleven clinical trials that will shape medicine in 2026."

The Phase 3 study has screened more than 230 patients and enrolled over 160 to date, with interim data expected in the first half of 2026. The Bria-IMT combination regimen has been granted FDA Fast Track designation.[investingnews +1](https://investingnews.com/briacell-s-phase-3-patient-enrollment-on-track-for-1h2026-topline-data-readout/)

Addressing Unmet Need in Breast Cancer

Metastatic breast cancer remains difficult to treat, particularly for patients who have exhausted standard options. While immunotherapy has transformed outcomes in some cancer types, its benefit in breast cancer has been more limited, with checkpoint inhibitors currently approved primarily for PD-L1 positive triple-negative disease.[pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih +1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10172210/)

"These clinical findings reinforce our confidence in the therapeutic potential and safety of the Bria-OTS platform," said Dr. William V. Williams, BriaCell's President and CEO. "Our team remains committed to advancing our novel therapeutic approach with the goal of making a meaningful difference for patients with metastatic breast cancer, particularly those with limited treatment options."
